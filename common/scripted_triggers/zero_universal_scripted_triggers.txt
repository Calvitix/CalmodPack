# I spent a lot of time on this mod out of my own free time, and nobody would like it if someone took their creation
# and stole it, and tried to claim it as thier's. If you want to learn to mod Stellaris, I'm not the best person to
# ask, but I'm always open to help and if you'd like to make new features or add-ons to this mod, send me a message,
# and we'll discuss together about either integrating them into this mod, or creating an add-on to this one.

#	Example:
#
#	example_trigger = {
#		nhsc_is_playable_empire = yes
#		num_communications > 0
#	}
#
#
#	In a script file:
#
#	trigger = {
#		example_trigger = yes
#	}
