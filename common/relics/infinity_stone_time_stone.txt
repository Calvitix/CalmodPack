# I spent a lot of time on this mod out of my own free time, and nobody would like it if someone took their creation
# and stole it, and tried to claim it as thier's. If you want to learn to mod Stellaris, I'm not the best person to
# ask, but I'm always open to help and if you'd like to make new features or add-ons to this mod, send me a message,
# and we'll discuss together about either integrating them into this mod, or creating an add-on to this one.
