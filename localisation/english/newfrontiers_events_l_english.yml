 newfrontiers_colony_event.1.name:0 "Ancient Machine"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.1.desc:0 "The research team on our new colony, [Root.GetName], discovered a strange structure deep in the ice of the planet. It appears to be some kind of ancient machine, probably built by a race that inhabited [Root.GetName] several thousand years ago. Preliminary investigations by our scientists show with confidence that the machine is an unusual terraforming device. Apparently, the ancient builders of this machine wanted to use it to transform the planet from a cold and gloomy world into a blooming garden. The operating principle of the machine is interesting. This ancient device is designed to generate a powerful beam, causing disturbances in the depths of the gas giant around which [Root.GetName] orbits. Our scientists believe this was intended to force the gas giant to emit a variety of gasses that would then be captured by [Root.GetName], causing a greenhouse effect. It is not clear whether the ancient race ever used the machine or instead abandoned the project.\n\nFor many thousands of years, the machine has been perfectly preserved, and our scientists have no doubt that they can start it if necessary. Alternately, we can just take it apart and study the technology of the ancients in more detail."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.2.name:0 "Ancient Machine Disassembled"
 newfrontiers_colony_event.2.desc:0 "Our scientists completed the dismantling of an ancient terraforming machine on [Root.GetName]. We will never know whether the machine would work or not, but our scientists report it is striking in its perfection. We will learn a lot about the technologies of the ancients upon further study of the components."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.3.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant began to change rapidly. Our physicists say that the beam ignited thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant. It looks like the machine really works, albeit in an unexpected way. The temperature on [Root.GetName] is rising evenly, and and its glaciers are beginning to melt."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.4.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant began to change rapidly.

The climate on [Root.GetName] is improving beyond our wildest expectations."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.5.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant began to change rapidly. Unfortunately the gas giant emitted far more gas than expected, blocking the starlight and plunging [Root.GetName] into a deep freeze. Few managed to escape as [Root.GetName] turned into a barren frozen world in a matter of days."
 newfrontiers_colony_event.6.desc:0 "The terraforming machine on [Root.GetName] has been activated. The machine fired its powerful beam, but then something strange happened - the gas giant began to change rapidly. Our physicists say that the beam ignited thermonuclear fusion deep inside the gas giant. Glaciers began to melt rapidly, but the shifting weight of the rising oceans destabilized [Root.GetName]'s tectonic plates. Magma unleashed from the planet's core reacted with its oceans on a massive scale, literally tearing the planet's crust apart. This occurred in just a few hours, and no one had time to escape."

 newfrontiers_action.1.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: life underground"
 newfrontiers_action.1.desc:0 "An extensive network of giant cavities connected by tunnels has been discovered on [Root.GetName]. The most interesting thing is that it seems that under the surface of this scorched world, a habitable atmosphere is somehow preserved. This network of huge and stunning caves has its own unique, albeit meager, biosphere. This place can be colonized."
 newfrontiers_action.3.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: life under the ice"
 newfrontiers_action.3.desc:0 "An extensive network of giant ice caves connected by tunnels has been discovered on [Root.GetName]. Under the icy shell of this seemingly dead world, there are huge cavities with a breathable nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. These caves are essentially air pockets of the frozen ocean that surrounds the entire planet. Despite the lack of light, the bowels of the planet warm the ocean, creating favorable conditions for the developed biosphere of this strange world. This place can be colonized."
 newfrontiers_action.4.desc:0 "§Y[FromFrom.GetName]§! has a high-pressure atmosphere that is toxic to most life forms. Nevertheless, a thriving biosphere has developed here, using ammonia as a solvent instead of water. The development of life went according to an environmental model that is significantly different from those that we know. The study if this world will significantly expand our knowledge of xenobiology."

The planet will not soon come out of this dangerous area of space and the surface may be subject to damage for months."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.38.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Incessant Thunderstorms"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.38.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], a season of severe storms and thunderstorms has begun. Monstrous cyclones form in the atmosphere, which cover entire continents and create zones of active convection. In these zones, a huge number of short-period electric discharges are formed, which move on the planet with a wide front and destroy everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.40.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Terrible Hurricanes"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.40.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season for the formation of convergent cyclones and anticyclones has begun. This event is marked by the formation of cyclones and anticyclones in areas with low and high temperatures, which then begin to actively collide.

 newfrontiers_periodic_event.42.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Heavy Blizzards"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.42.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the global sandstorm season has begun. During this period, foci of sandstorms form on the planet, which can reach sizes of several thousand kilometers in diameter. In the areas covered by such a storm, few can survive in the open."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.44.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Heavy Sandstorms"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.44.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the global snowstorm season has begun. When the season of strong winds comes, they raise tons of snow into the atmosphere. A colossal cloud covers the entire planet, blocking out most sunluight. The temperature difference further enhances the activity of snow cyclones and the planet remains in cold captivity for a long time."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.46.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Prolonged Drought"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.46.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], a season of long drought has begun.

 newfrontiers_periodic_event.48.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Coriolis Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.48.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season of the formation of strong Coriolis storms began. In this season of solar activity, a strong temperature difference occurs between the day and night side of the planet. As a result, a strong pressure drop occurs in the equatorial regions, which constantly shifts towards the terminator. A hurricane wind occurs in the drop zone, which is greatly enhanced by the rotation of the planet. Large expanses of flat plains on the continents offer no obstacles to the constant acceleration of the Coriolis storm. A hurricane wind passes through a wide front across the entire surface of the planet and can reach 700 km/h, sweeping away everything in their path."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.50.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Geomagnetic Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.50.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], a season of constant geomagnetic storms has begun. The has planet entered the zone of intense solar wind, which creates large disturbances in the geomagnetic field of the planet. The interaction of ionized particles occurs over almost the entire surface of the planet’s magnetosphere. This causes malfunctioning of all electromagnetic devices and inevitably leads to a drop in the production capacity of the planet."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.52.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Ion Storm"
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.52.desc:0 "On [Root.GetName], the season of ion storms has begun. The weakening of the planet’s magnetosphere leads to ionization of the upper atmosphere and provokes the emergence of monstrous and destructive storms. These storms create a background of electrical discharges that inflict huge damage in the affected area. The zones of ionic storms turn into lifeless wastelands."
 newfrontiers_periodic_event.54.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Wild Hunt"
