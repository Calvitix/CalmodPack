 fix_ai_actions_event.3.custom_tooltip.e:0 "Stops the AI from spamming corvettes and destroyers by putting a cap on corvettes to 60 and destroyers to 30 per fleet. Once the AI reaches the cap(s), 2 corvettes are replaced with a destroyer and 2 destroyers are replaced with a cruiser. This should make AI fleets less corvette spammy and stronger (the 2 for 1 trade-off works out economically). This only occurs when possible, i.e. when the AI has destroyer technology and cruiser technology for balance reasons.\n\nThis will save on some performance if not clicked (not greyed out)."
 fix_ai_actions_event.3.custom_tooltip.f:0 "Reduces the AI's pops by introducing a scaling modifier giving positive 0-80% pop resource production and diplomatic weight from pops; negative 0-80% pop growth speed and pop assembly speed, both in increments of 4% every 2 years. This will effectively half AI's pops in the galaxy and replace it with equivalent economy for balance. This should provide a high performance boost, maintaining a reasonably balanced AI gameplay.\n\nThis will save on some performance if not clicked (not greyed out)."
 fix_ai_actions_event.3.custom_tooltip.g:0 "Reduces the AI's pops by introducing a scaling modifier giving positive 0-160% pop resource production and diplomatic weight from pops; negative 0-80% pop growth speed and pop assembly speed, both in 10% increments every 100 total pops.\n\nThis will save on some performance if not clicked (not greyed out)."
 fix_ai_actions_event.3.custom_tooltip.h:0 "As a preference, you can enable some of the AI fixes to be also performed on players for potential balance and further performance gains. These currently include: AI Corvette Spam Fix, AI Unemployment Fix and AI Pop Count Conversion Fix.\n\nThis will save on some performance if clicked (greyed out)."
